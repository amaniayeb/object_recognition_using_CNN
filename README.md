# Multi-Class Object Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing 10 different object classes using a dataset such as CIFAR-10. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to building, training, and evaluating the model.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
